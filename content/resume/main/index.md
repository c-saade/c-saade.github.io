 From a fundamental research background, I enjoy tackling complex problems through data analysis.
 My [PhD](https://www.theses.fr/2022UMONG048) led me to work mainly with Python and R, but I'm always interested in learning new tools and approaches.
 I have a strong ability for self-learning, which allowed me to solve a wide variety of problems such as fitting demographic models on [ecological](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13692) [data](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0543) using bayesian statistics, or [automated species identification](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0543) and counting from videos data.
 I now intend to put my skills to use in the field of data science.
 
 # Skills
  - R for data science (Tidyverse, Rmarkdown, ggplot...)
  - Python for data science (Pandas, sklearn, seaborn...)
  - SQL
  - Tableau
  
 # Experience
 
 ## PhD in Theoretical Ecology
 
 2019-2022, Université de Montpellier
 
 Working on the fascinating topic of ecosystem stability in the context of global changes. Conducting research at the crossroads of life science and mathematics led me to develop technical abilities, such as:
    - [machine learning]({{< ref "/Species_id">}}), applied to automated species recognition from video data,
    - bayesian statistics, to fit demographic and epidemiological models to experimental time series,
    - formal mathematics (linear algebra, differential equations...), in particular the developpement of a dimension reduction methods for spatially structured dynamical systems.

  ## Research internship in Evolutionary Game Theory
  
  2017, University of British Columbia - Vancouver
  
  Investigating the effect of environmental heterogeneity and environment-agent feedbacks on the evolutionary stable strategies of classical games.

  ## Research internship in Macro-evolution
  
  2016, École Normale Supérieure - Paris
  
  Developping methods to infer past phenotypes from the phylogenies of co-evolving clades (*e.g.*, fig and fig wasps).
  A first step into the world of bayesian statistics that led me to code a bayesian integrator from scratch to handle the complex model structures involved.
