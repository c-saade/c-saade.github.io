 From a fundamental research background, I enjoy tackling complex problems through data analysis.
 My [PhD](https://www.theses.fr/2022UMONG048) led me to work mainly with Python and R, but I'm always interested in learning new tools and approaches.
 I have a strong ability for self-learning, which allowed me to solve a wide variety of problems such as fitting demographic models on [ecological](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13692) [data](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0543) using bayesian statistics, or [automated species identification](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0543) and counting from videos data.
 I now intend to put my skills to use in the field of data science.
 
 # Skills
  - R for data science (Tidyverse, Rmarkdown, ggplot...)
  - Python for data science (Pandas, sklearn, seaborn...)
  - SQL
  - Linux
  - Tableau
  
 # Experience
 
 ## PhD in Theoretical Ecology
 
 2019-2022, Université de Montpellier
 
 Working on the fascinating topic of ecosystem stability in the context of global changes. Conducting research at the crossroads of life sciences and mathematics led me to:
    - Entirely automate species recognition and count from video data using [machine learning]({{< ref "/Species_id">}}), reaching up to 99% accuracy _vs._ 80% for human observers.
    This allowed to [monitor the dynamics of 270 microbial cultures](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0543), a tenfold increase from human recognition and counting. 
    - Succesfully fit complex demographic and epidemiological models to time series using [bayesian statistics]({{< ref "/bayes_demo_fit">}}).
    This allowed to parameterize an _in silico_ [reproduction of a lab experiment](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0543) and to estimate the transmission rate and virulence of an [intra-cellular parasite](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13692).
    - Develop a dimension reduction method for spatially structured dynamical systems using formal mathematics.

  ## Research internship in Evolutionary Game Theory
  
  2017, University of British Columbia - Vancouver
  
  Investigating the effect of environmental heterogeneity and environmental feedbacks on the evolutionary stable strategies of classical games.
  I developed a novel framework for evolutionary game theory in which an agent's strategy affects its local environment, and an agent's environment affects its fitness, resulting in a strategy-environment feedback.
  This [research project](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.11.019) involved both numerical simulations and analytical modeling.

  ## Research internship in Macro-evolution
  
  2016, École Normale Supérieure - Paris
  
  Developping methods to infer past phenotypes from the phylogenies of co-evolving clades (*e.g.*, figs and fig wasps).
  A first step into the world of bayesian statistics that led me to code a bayesian integrator from scratch to handle the complex model structures involved.
