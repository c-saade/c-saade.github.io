description: From a biology background, I developed data-related skills in R and Python during my [PhD](https://www.theses.fr/2022UMONG048) in theoretical ecology regarding the dynamics and stability of spatially structured ecosystem. I currently use my skills as a statistician at Sanofi, where I work on the R&D of vaccines.
